# hello-world
Wiki tells me everyting!
I'm hoping to understand Octoprint and be able to manipulate my 3D printer.
How everything works, from quantum menchanics to astrophysics fascinates me.  What I've gotten to is designing and building cars and trucks at work and 3D printing and a little bit of programming at home, with music as a hobby and fitness as a goal.  Hope everyone out there can figure out what their dreams are and pursue them.  Quo Vadis?
